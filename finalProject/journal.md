**Brain teaser in Colors **

While making the piano keyboard in past projects, I got inspired to use the ability of button-switches as a response to screen action. For the final project, I was planning to incoorporate physically interactive system that challenges our perception, reflexes and text-to-color recognition. 
Hence, I would like to create a game interface that involves fast back-and-forth interaction with Arduino and the screen controlled by p5.js. and immediate response from the user. 

My favorite games are brain teasers and I decided to do a game interface for one. It will be about the color recognition. A word, say 'Blue' is presented in the p5js, while the background behind the word is a green background. The user should click the button on Arduino which is of the color that the word represents - in this case, that is a blue button. I want to see how fast can a human react in recognizing the correct color instead confusing it with the color in the background. Additionally, I plan to add a LED lamps of corresponding colors, as well as specific sounds for each color so that I help the brain recognize the colors better. With different levels, the game speeds up and you need to react quicker. As well, the background colors start mixing, so you would get both green and yellow miixing in the background, while the word presented is 'blue' and you still have to click the blue button. The one who can react correctly to the highest number of tasks earns the most points.
