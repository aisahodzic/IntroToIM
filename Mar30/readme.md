**Description**

For this project, I was looking around and trying to find a common motions that are repeating thoughtout a day, or a short study session. There were many action that I have considered that could be used as a switch, such as moving a chair, swinging chair back and front, pluging and unplugging a charger etc. Since I was studying from a notebook, an idea came up to me to use my notebook as a switch! To be more precise, a light would turn on each time when the notebook is open which should mean that I'm studying (hopefully actually and not daydreaming) and closing the notebook would mean that the light will be turned off. 

**Process**
I googled materials that would be good for this. I surely needed longer wires or connecting wires to accomodate for the distance of the notebook to my breadboard. I would also need conductive material such that I expand the area that is touching and thus acting as a switch, since wires are too thin if we want to have a guaranteed connection. I found a couple of tutorials that used copper tape to make a circuit that gave me a better picture of how my product should look like. This video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcl6CqFLJOU) gave a solid understanding of the usefulness of copper tape. 

**Problems**
Once I had my working idea, I was ready to start working. I went to IM lab to borrow long wires and copper tape. I got this brown tape. I spent long time trying to make my circuit work with this one, and even more time googling to check it this is actually a copper tape - I thought there might be different variants. I gave up, understading that it's either not actually a copper tape or I didn't figure out how to use it properly. I packed my stuff and went to IM lab again to get myself the copper tape that I actually needed.

**Discoveries**

Copper tape is so cool! It almost felt like magic when we connect two different wires, and the LED lamps lights up. Using copper tape to do so is even cooler because the two wires are not touching directly, yet we are able to light up a lamp!
