  This is the first homework project to make a portrait using p5.js. The screenshot and the code of my portrait are attached.
  
  The main difficulty that I had was how to draw my hair - none of the geometric shapes that I knew how to use was appropriate to represent my hair. Finally, I decided to use a combination of lines that go in different direction. It was difficult to navigate the numbers and mouse location. MouseX and MouseY was of great help but it is difficult to track back a mistake since numbers in the code get very confusing.
  The most interesting thing I discovered is how to set up the colors. Since we were talking about RBG as color definition for p5js, I found it amaizng that I can experiment with various numbers and find the colors I want. The page I found - https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html was amazing in helping me find the right nubmers for very nuanced colors, for example shades for skin, mouth or hair colors.
