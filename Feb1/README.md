  This is the first homework project to make a portrait using p5.js. The screenshot and the code of my portrait are attached.
  
  The main difficulty that I had was how to draw my hair - none of the geometric shapes that I knew how to use was appropriate to represent my hair. Finally, I decided to use a combination of lines that go in different direction. The most interesting thing I discovered is how to set up the colors. Since we were talking about RBG as color definition for p5js, I found it amaizng that I can experiment with various numbers and find the colors I want. The page I found - https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html was amazing in helping me find the right nubmers for very nuanced colors, for example shades for skin, mouth or hair colors.
